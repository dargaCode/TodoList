# Udemy Task Tracker
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS/JQUERY</strong>

Another <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/3886430">Udemy course</a> project, and also my first project using jQuery! Surprisingly, the CSS turned out to be the tough part.

I made some changes from the example, and ended up using a branch for the first time, so I could test out everything separately.  

Unfortunately a refresh resets the list, but this project could be a good candidate to revisit after I learn to save data in cookies.
